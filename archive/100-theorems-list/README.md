In this folder, we keep proofs of theorems on the [100 theorems list](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/) which don't occur naturally in mathlib.


If you prove a new theorem from that list, you should add appropriate data to this file:
https://github.com/leanprover-community/leanprover-community.github.io/blob/newsite/data/100.yaml
