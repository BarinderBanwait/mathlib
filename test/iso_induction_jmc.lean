`iso_rw e`, where `e : X ‚âÖ Y`, `X Y : C` should try to replace all instances of `X` in the goal with `Y`.
To do this, it attempts to:
1. Re-expresses the goal as some functor `F : C ‚•§ Type` applied to the object `X`.
2. Invokes `apply F.map (e.inv)`, to obtain the goal `F.obj Y`.
3. Substitute back in the definition of `F`, and definitionally simplify.
