Let's set ourselves some ambitious goals.

We'd like to (easily, automatically) prove:
1. that if R ‚âÖ S as commutative rings, then R[X] ‚âÖ S[X] as rings.
2. that is R ‚âÖ S as commutative rings, and R is local, the S is local.

What do we need?

There are some issues because of bundling,
but let's ignore those for now, and just deal
with proving functoriality.
