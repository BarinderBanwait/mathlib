Let's set ourselves some ambitious goals.

We'd like to (easily, automatically) prove:
1. that if R ‚âÖ S as commutative rings, then R[X] ‚âÖ S[X] as rings.
2. that is R ‚âÖ S as commutative rings, and R is local, the S is local.

What do we need?

There are some issues because of bundling,
but let's ignore those for now, and just deal
with proving functoriality.

-- We want to build an instance of the (not-yet-written)

-- How are we going to do that?
-- The only way is brute force: we're going to start at type level.

def iso_functorial.map.to_fun {R S : CommRing} (i : R ‚âÖ S) : Polynomial R ‚Üí Polynomial S :=
begin
  dsimp [Polynomial],
  intro X,
  -- transport X, -- This certainly doesn't work yet, but we may be reasonably close.

-- Now we need to hope that all the algebraic axioms work out!

def iso_functorial.map.map_one : sorry := sorry
def iso_functorial.map.map_mul : sorry := sorry
-- etc

-- We can now put those facts together as

def iso_functorial.map {R S : CommRing} (i : R ‚âÖ S) : Polynomial R ‚ü∂ Polynomial S :=
sorry

-- And then we need to prove `iso_functorial.map_id` and `iso_functorial.map_comp`,
-- which should be consequences of the behaviour of `transport`.
-- (Note that means "practical" rather than "logical" consequences, since `transport` is meta.)
